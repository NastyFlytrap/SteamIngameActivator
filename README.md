Steam In-Game Activator is here! Its simple, but great!
It saves your settings into a settings.cfg right next to the exe, so you dont even have to type them in later!

Compiled with Visual studio 2019, .NET Framework 4.8 (although you shouldnt need .NET to run it....)

1.0 is DONE!

Binaries ADDED!

Graphical flair ADDED!

To use this, find a game that still uses steam_appid.txt to decide which game you're going to be 'in', these are mostly pre 2013 games when valve switched to using the steamworks API for this purpose.

Notable games include: Team Fortress 2 (free), clicker heroes (free), and many others:https://steam.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_DRM-free_games

My choice is Kung Fury however, because it can be gimped to use up basically no system resources, and be hidden. In TF2 the 'game' is going to be your error message, which you cant hide. 

To get this to work, go to the directory where the game exe is, usually under 'SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\GAME' select the steam_appid.txt, give it a new AppID, save the AppID,
Find the exe, and start it!

Of course, you can do this by hand, i merely created a window to make it easier, so you dont have to go into a folder every time you want to change the game you're in
